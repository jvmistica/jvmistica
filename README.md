Hi, Iâ€™m Joann.

I enjoy automating tasks, learning/applying new tools, and writing documentation. Most of my projects are written in either Go or Python. I published some articles involving some of my Python projects at https://hubpages.com/@butterontoasts. When something sparks my curiosity, I want to learn how it works by trying to build it myself. This is also my way of practicing my coding and design skills. I'm always open for constructive feedback and I like helping people so feel free to reach out!

<b>Background</b>

I was born in the Philippines and moved to Austria in 2022. I lived in Vienna for a while and eventually moved to Graz. I'm currently taking German lessons while working for a company as a backend engineer.

When I was a child, I grew up surrounded with arcades. I played a lot of video games growing up and dreamed of making my own someday. When it was time to pick a course, something that involved computers and programming was the obvious choice. While working for different companies, I developed an interest in building services and components that do not relate to games. I especially enjoy building automations, research, learning and applying new tools to optimise existing processes. They say it's not so common for people working in this field but I like writing documentation. Helping people (and also myself) find their way through guides and collaboration gives me satisfaction for my job.

At the moment, I work mostly with Golang (Go), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), PostgreSQL, and others. I have experience in Python and other languages and I'm always excited to learn new tools and see how I can incorporate them to new or existing projects.
