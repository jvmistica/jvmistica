Hi! Iâ€™m Joann.


I enjoy automating tasks, learning/applying new tools, and writing documentation. When something sparks my curiosity, I want to learn how it works by trying to build it myself. This is also my way of practicing my development and design skills.

I grew up surrounded with arcades, played a lot of video games, and dreamed of making my own someday. This led me to a career in software development where my interest in building things expanded beyond video games. I especially enjoy building automations, doing research, writing documentation, learning and applying new tools to improve existing processes. Helping people (and also myself) find their way through guides and collaboration gives me satisfaction in my job.

My dedication to continuous improvement extends beyond my professional career. In my personal time, I cultivate indoor gardens, experimenting with different systems like hydroponics, and findings ways to enhance efficiency and sustainability. This hands-on experience reinforces my commitment to finding innovative and effective solutions in all aspects of my work.
